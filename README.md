# Dynamic Forms in React Using Zod and React Hook Form

This project demonstrates how to implement dynamic forms in React using TypeScript, Zod, and React Hook Form. The forms adapt their validation logic based on user input, making it a flexible and powerful tool for handling complex form scenarios.

## Features

- React with TypeScript for strong type safety
- Vite 5 for fast development and build setup
- Zod for schema validation and discriminated unions
- React Hook Form for managing form state and validation
- Dynamic form inputs like radio button groups and checkboxes
- Extensible design to support any dynamic form scenario
